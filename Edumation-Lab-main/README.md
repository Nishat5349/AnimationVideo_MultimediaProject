## Ojective
This is for educational aspect. 
This lecture videos/animations will help the students' of class 9 & 10 of bangla medium. We want to teach them in a very interesting way.
* Here we choose "Banga language" as there are not enough resourses available for bangla medium students.
### Here our first lecture video is on "Chemical Bond". This animation video is based on the materials of class 9-10 chemistry book, chapter- 05(Chemical bond). Our students can visualize actually how chemical bonds are created between different atoms by watching this video.
