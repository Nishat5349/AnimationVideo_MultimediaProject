## Ojectives
This is for the educational aspect. 
This lecture video/animation will help the students of classes 9 & 10 of Bangla medium. We want to teach them in a very interesting way.
* Here we choose "Banga language" as there are not enough resources available for Bangla medium students.
### Here our first lecture video is on "Chemical Bond". This animation video is based on class 9-10 chemistry book materials, chapter- 05(Chemical bond). Our students can visualize actually how chemical bonds are created between different atoms by watching this video.
